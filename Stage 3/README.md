# **Gender-Based Comparative Gene Expression and Functional Enrichment in Melanoma Samples**
 
## **Description**
This project explores the role that sex plays in Melanoma. It is split into multiple parts
1. Differential Expression Analysis
2. Functional enrichment analysis
3. k-NN Analysis

Dataset:TCGA-SKCM

*Biomarker Discovery*
You will need the following packages in RStudio:
![68747470733a2f2f6c68372d72742e676f6f676c6575736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f646f63737a2f41445f346e5866376371615537676b4363524e70654232643943662d583859664b6d646164324a5f78346733566d50325557666c75637830554b4434506774497](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce2b1181-4157-4b3f-bec5-3c1f3dff3600)

These packages can be installed using install.packages()

### **Preprocessing**
1. Dataset is uploaded directly onto RStudio using TCGABiolink, then preproccessed by:
  1. Subsetting into the designated groups 
     ![68747470733a2f2f6c68372d72742e676f6f676c6575736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f646f63737a2f41445f346e58633544567153466e654d674f72584f587138415f6e4a52466c5152487765584b37546c484b4e514c3972727272574535796c4c5f3138304c67566](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8abf333-3a15-4d50-b310-f8c9c9ae9e9b)
  2. Normalization
  3. Filteration with a quantile cut off 0.25 

### **Differential Expressionn Analysis**
1. Metastatic and primary data is grouped together
2. Treatment level DEA is performed
3. Ouput is used as data to generate heatmaps comparing the clustering of males vs females in both tumor types

### **Functional Enrichment Analysis**
1. The up and downregulated genes for all 4 subsets are extracted individually
2. The data undergoes functional enrichment analysis (particularly gene ontology), selecting the top 5 pathways.
3. Results a

### **Functional Enrichment Analysis Visualization**
1. Group the pathway name, the number of genes, and the negative log10 of the FDR generated from the website
2. Generate a simple plot using ggplot2. The plot can be customizable. Some of the simple plots can be:
     - Lollipop plot
     - Line plot
     - Bubble plot
     - Dot plot

Happy Analyzing!

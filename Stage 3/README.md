# **Gender-Based Comparative Gene Expression and Functional Analysis on Melanoma Samples**
 
## **Description**
This project explores the role that sex plays in Melanoma. It is split into multiple parts
1. Differential Expression Analysis
2. Gene Function Analysis
3. k-NN Analysis

Dataset: TCGA-SKCM

*Biomarker Discovery*

You will need the following packages in RStudio:
![68747470733a2f2f6c68372d72742e676f6f676c6575736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f646f63737a2f41445f346e5866376371615537676b4363524e70654232643943662d583859664b6d646164324a5f78346733566d50325557666c75637830554b4434506774497](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce2b1181-4157-4b3f-bec5-3c1f3dff3600)

These packages can be installed using install.packages()

### **Preprocessing**
1. Dataset is uploaded directly onto RStudio using TCGABiolink, then preproccessed by:
  1. Subsetting into the designated groups 
     ![68747470733a2f2f6c68372d72742e676f6f676c6575736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f646f63737a2f41445f346e58633544567153466e654d674f72584f587138415f6e4a52466c5152487765584b37546c484b4e514c3972727272574535796c4c5f3138304c67566](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8abf333-3a15-4d50-b310-f8c9c9ae9e9b)
  2. Normalization
  3. Filteration with a quantile cut off = 0.25 

### **Differential Expression Analysis**
1. Metastatic and primary data is grouped together
2. Treatment level DEA is performed with logfc = 2 and FDR cut = 0.1
3. Output is used as data to generate heatmaps comparing the clustering of males vs females in both tumor types

### **Gene Function Analysis**
1. The up and downregulated genes for all 4 subsets are extracted individually
2. The data undergoes functional analysis (particularly gene ontology), selecting the top 5 pathways.
3. Results are visualized in a barplot form and the PDF is saved on the computer

*Machine Learning*
1. Perform k-NN analysis  to classify melanoma samples
     - The code was implemented by using the class package in R.
     - 80/20 train-test split is employed.
     - The k-NN algorithm execution with varying values of (k) (from 1 to the number of training samples) to optimize accuracy.
2. A confusion matrix is generated 
3. An analysis vs K plot are generated

Happy Analyzing!
